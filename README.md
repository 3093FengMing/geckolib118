Geckolib is an entity animation loader for Java Edition, which lets you export bedrock animations and play them automatically.

## Installation
[![curseforge](https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/versions/geckolib.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/geckolib)

We use jitpack for publishing as it provides easy access to releases and allows for javadocs in the jars (unlike curseforge).
```gradle
repositories {
    maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
}

dependencies {
    implementation 'com.github.bernie-g:geckolib:1.0.0-1.15'
}
```
## Documentation
GeckoLib provides detailed documentation in the form of a [wiki](https://github.com/bernie-g/geckolib/wiki) and javadocs.
