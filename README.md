Geckolib is an entity animation loader for Java Edition, which lets you export bedrock animations and play them automatically.

## Installation

Currently waiting on Cazsius to host the mod, long story short, wait a few days and you'll be able to install it. I'll update this page when it's up.

## Documentation
GeckoLib provides detailed documentation in the form of a [wiki](https://github.com/bernie-g/geckolib/wiki) and javadocs.
